**Excel Bike Shop Customer Data Analysis**
**Overview:**
This Excel project focuses on analyzing customer data from a bike shop to highlight important insights related to bike sales. By leveraging pivot tables and slicers, we aim to provide an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore key customer information such as bike sales based on customer age, commute distance, and average income.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project consists of customer data from a bike shop. It includes information such as customer age, commute distance, average income, and bike sales.

**Key Insights:**
_Bike Sales by Customer Age:_ This analysis visualizes bike sales based on customer age groups. By segmenting customers into age brackets, viewers can understand which age groups contribute the most to bike sales and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

_Bike Sales by Commute Distance:_ This analysis explores bike sales based on the distance customers commute. By categorizing customers by commute distance, viewers can identify potential opportunities to promote bikes as a mode of transportation for short or long commutes.

_Bike Sales by Average Income:_ This analysis examines bike sales based on the average income of customers. By analyzing sales trends among different income levels, viewers can gain insights into the purchasing power of customers and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.

**Dashboard Features:**
_Interactive Pivot Tables:_ Pivot tables are used to summarize and analyze customer data, allowing users to dynamically explore bike sales based on various factors such as age, commute distance, and income.

_Slicers:_ Slicers are implemented to provide interactive filtering options, allowing users to drill down into key information and customize their analysis based on specific criteria.

**Conclusion:**
Through the use of Excel pivot tables and slicers, this project offers valuable insights into bike sales patterns among customers of a bike shop. By analyzing customer data based on age, commute distance, and average income, we provide actionable insights for the bike shop to optimize marketing strategies and drive sales growth.
